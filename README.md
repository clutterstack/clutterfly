# WhereMachines

Incomplete client for the Fly Machines API.

## FlyApi

Functions to validate bodies for Machines API calls using schemas generated by https://github.com/clutterstack/openapi-json-to-ecto. 

Makes the API calls via https://github.com/ckreiling/fly_machines

Set a token for the app using `export FLY_API_TOKEN=$(fly tokens deploy -a <appname>)` if running from a machine with flyctl running on it.

Run `iex -S mix` to compile and drop to an iex shell where you can run commands like 

```
Clutterfly.Commands.run_min_config
```

to start a tiny machine.
